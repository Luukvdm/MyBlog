<h2>1. Goals</h2>

<p>Logging is very important for security in my application.
It can help with detecting attacks, debugging and examining what
is going on in the application.
So I want to log not only errors but also events that happen within
the application.</p>

<p>I also want the logs that get saved to a file to have a different format
then the logs in the console.
Because logs that I understand and logs that a machine understands are very different.</p>

<h2>2. Design</h2>

<h3>2.1 What To Log</h3>

<p>I want to log the fellowing events:
- Creation of a job
- Job status change
- Sending of SSE messages
- Queries/ commands
- Auth events
- Exceptions</p>

<p>I also want to pay attention to not log any private information like the passwords of users.</p>

<h3>2.2 Logging Technology</h3>

<p>My project is build with the Asp.Net Core framework. I want to use
the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging/5.0.0-rc.2.20475.5">Microsoft.Extensions.Logging</a> interface for logging.
This means using the provided ILogger interface provided by the Microsoft package. The package still needs a provider like
<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/5.0.0-rc.2.20475.5">this console provider</a>.</p>

<p>I want to use the ILogger abstraction with the <a href="https://serilog.net/">Serilog</a> provider. I want to use Serlig because its easy
to use and has a nice way of customizing the output format.</p>

<h3>2.3 Logging Format</h3>

<p>Serilog extends the .Net string format so the output format can be changed without having to change allot of code.<br/>
The format that I want to use is going to look something like this:
<code class="plaintext">
00:00:00 [&lt;level&gt;] &lt;message&gt;
</code>
If I later figure out that a different format like Json objects are more useful for me or the blue team, than I only have to change a
single configuration file.</p>

<h2>3. Implementation Examples</h2>

<p>The ILogger interface has multiple levels for logging messages. This helps with finding the most important logging messages that need
attention the quickest.</p>

<p><strong>The ILogger interface:</strong>
<pre><code class="csharp">
  /// &lt;summary&gt;Defines logging severity levels.&lt;/summary&gt;
  public enum LogLevel
  {
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data.
    /// These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    Trace,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development.  These logs should primarily contain
    /// information useful for debugging and have no long-term value.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    Debug,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    Information,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but do not otherwise cause the
    /// application execution to stop.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    Warning,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a
    /// failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    Error,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires
    /// immediate attention.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    Critical,
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Not used for writing log messages. Specifies that a logging category should not write any messages.
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    None,
  }
</code></pre></p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m using Mediatr with a CQRS pattern in my application, its very easy to log all queries and commands.<br/>

<strong>Logging behaveiour for commands and queries:</strong>
<pre><code>
public class LoggingBehaviour<TRequest> : IRequestPreProcessor<TRequest>
{
    private readonly ILogger <em>logger;
    private readonly ICurrentUserService </em>currentUserService;
    private readonly GlobalSettings _globalSettings;</p>

    public LoggingBehaviour(ILogger&lt;TRequest&gt; logger, ICurrentUserService currentUserService, GlobalSettings globalSettings){...}

    public Task Process(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        string requestName = typeof(TRequest).Name;
        string userId = _currentUserService.UserId ?? string.Empty;
        string userName = string.Empty;

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(userId))
        {
            userName = _currentUserService.UserEmail;
        }

        _logger.LogInformation("{ProjectName} Request: {Name} {@UserId} {@UserName} {@Request}",
            _globalSettings.ProjectName, requestName, userId, userName, request);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Something similar can be achieved for logging exceptions. By creating a different middleware for catching exceptions and logging
them before handling them gracefully with a MVC filter.</p>

<pre><code>
public class UnhandledExceptionBehaviour&lt;TRequest, TResponse> : IPipelineBehavior&lt;TRequest, TResponse>
{
    private readonly ILogger<TRequest> <em>logger;
    private readonly GlobalSettings </em>globalSettings;</p>

    public UnhandledExceptionBehaviour(ILogger&lt;TRequest&gt; logger, GlobalSettings globalSettings){...}

    public async Task&lt;TResponse&gt; Handle(TRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken, RequestHandlerDelegate&lt;TResponse&gt; next)
    {
        try
        {
            return await next();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            string requestName = typeof(TRequest).Name;

            _logger.LogError(ex, "{ProjectName} Request: Unhandled Exception for Request {Name} {@Request}", 
                _globalSettings.ProjectName, requestName, request);

            throw;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For other events like domain events I need to call the log function in every event. This is necessary because every event is different.
And writing a behaviour for every Mediatr notification can&rsquo;t be done without missing out on allot of information about the event that
otherwise could be used to log more useful information.</p>
