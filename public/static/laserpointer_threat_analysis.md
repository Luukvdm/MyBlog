## 1. Threat Actors

I imagine my application being self hosted by a red team. 
I tried thinking of misuse cases and threat actors in this situation.

## 2. Misuse Cases

### 2.1 First Sketch

I started with a sketch to figure out what the use cases in my application where. 
I also thought about things a hacker might try to exploit.

### 2.2 Final Version

In the final version I added more misuse cases. I also thought about how to mitigate those possible exploits.
The only thing that I might improve on this misuse case diagram is adding more use cases. 
For example, I might create a administrator role inside the applications that has more use cases.
