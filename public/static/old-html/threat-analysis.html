<h2>1. Threat Actors</h2>

<p>I imagine my application being self hosted by a red team. I tried thinking of
misuse cases and threat actors in this situation.</p>

<h2>2. Misuse Cases</h2>

<h3>2.1 First Sketch</h3>

<p>I started with a sketch to figure out what the use cases in my application where.
I also thought about things a hacker might try to exploit.</p>

<h3>2.2 Final version</h3>

<p>In the final version I added more misuse cases. I also thought about how to mitigate those possible
exploits.<br/>
The only thing that I might improve on this misuse case diagram is adding more use cases.
For example, I might create a administrator role inside the applications that
has more use cases.</p>
